All our forums now use Google Groups, which allows for both web and email interaction.


Please follow these recommendations when posting a question:

* Please post to the relevant group. DO NOT post setup, configuration, adminstration questions to Drools Usage
* Before posting first search the archives for similar questions. Searches should include Google Groups, StackOverflow and Jira.
* Get to the point. Keep it as short as possible.
* Include _relevant_ technical details (version, stacktrace, short code snippet, ...).
* Be polite, friendly and clear. Reread your question before posting it.
* Be patient. Do not email people directly. This isn't link:product.html[paid support].
