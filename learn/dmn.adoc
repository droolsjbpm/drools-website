____
DMN is trying to do for Business Decision Management what BPMN did for Business Process Management a decade ago: empower the business to take charge of the logic that drives its operations, through a vendor-independent diagramming language.  To be effective, that language must be both usable by business analysts and stakeholders in the business and verifiable for completeness and consistency.  DMN is both.
