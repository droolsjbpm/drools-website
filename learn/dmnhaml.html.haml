%h1 DMN
%p{:class => "lead"} 
  The Decision Model and Notation (DMN™) is a Standard by OMG® providing a common and visual notation readily understandable by all users and personas.
  With DMN, business analysts can define the initial decision requirements and then formalize more detailed decision models; technical developers can automate the decisions in any process with a portable execution semantic, while business stakeholders can manage and monitor those decisions.
%p
  The official webpage of the DMN Standard specification is available at
  %a{ :href => "https://www.omg.org/dmn", :title => "DMN Specification" } OMG website

        DMN is trying to do for Business Decision Management what BPMN did for Business Process Management a decade ago: empower the business to take charge of the logic that drives its operations, through a vendor-independent diagramming language.
        To be effective, that language must be both usable by business analysts and stakeholders in the business and verifiable for completeness and consistency.
        DMN is both.
